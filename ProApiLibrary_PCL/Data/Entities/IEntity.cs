	/// <summary>
	/// The root interface for all Entities
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// (e.g. <seealso cref="IPerson"/>, <seealso cref="IBusiness"/>, <seealso cref="IPhone"/>, and <seealso cref="Location"/>).
	/// 
	/// <p>The Whitepages API presents its data in a directed graph form, whereby:</p>
	/// <ul>
	///     <li>Each node is an <seealso cref="IEntity"/>, and</li>
	///     <li>each Edge is an <seealso cref="Association"/>.</li>
	/// </ul>
	/// 
	/// Entities contain data intrinsic to the entity, whereas associations
	/// contain data pertaining to the relationship between its source and destination
	/// entities
	/// 
	/// <h2>Properties</h2>
	/// 
	/// <p>Entity properties are optionally filled in; factors include
	/// the query type and the API Key configuration. When a value is not
	/// available, its accessor is filled in with a {@code null} value,
	/// therefore it is a good idea to check the nullness of property
	/// values before using them.</p>
	/// 
	/// <h2>Traversal</h2>
	/// 
	/// <p>There are two ways to traverse the graph:</p>
	/// <ol>
	///     <li>Explicit traversal through the association, and</li>
	///     <li>Direct traversal to the associated entity.</li>
	/// </ol>
	/// <p>The former is useful when information on the association is desired;
	/// however, one is often interested only in the associated entity itself,
	/// in which case direct traversal is clearer.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>For example, the following two lines have the same effect:</p>
	/// <pre>
	/// {@code
	/// Person p1 = phone.getPersonAssociations().get(0).getPerson();
	/// Person p2 = phone.getPeople().get(0);
	/// p1 == p2 //is true
	/// }
	/// </pre>
	/// <p>Careful readers of the above example will note that extra safety code is needed
	/// to check that the returned lists are non-null and non-empty before
	/// calling {@code get()}.</p>
	/// 
	/// <h2>Proxies</h2>
	/// 
	/// <p>The complete entity graph, traversed to its full extent, would
	/// be incredibly large, thus, in practice, only a subset of this graph
	/// is presented in the Response.
	/// As a result, in some cases you may encounter associations whose nodes
	/// are not available to you. When this occurs, an appropriate <seealso cref="EntityProxy"/>
	/// instance is put into its place. To test if an entity is a proxy, use
	/// the this.IsProxy accessor.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>Entity proxies satisfy the appropriate entity interface, returning
	/// null for all the values -- acting as if the values were masked
	/// from you. The exception to this rule is the ID of the associated entity,
	/// which is always present on a proxy value.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>To load an entity, call the this.Load() method. <em>This method
	/// will make a call to the remote service</em>, fetching information for
	/// the associated entity ID. To test if a value has been loaded, the
	/// this.IsLoaded() method may be used.</p>
	/// 
	/// <seealso cref="IPerson"/>
